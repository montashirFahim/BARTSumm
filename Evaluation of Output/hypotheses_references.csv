"[ purpose ] this study investigated the effect of trunk stability exercise and a combined exercise program on pain , flexibility , and 
 static balance in chronic low back pain patients . 
 [ subjects and methods ] thirty patients with chronic low 
 back pain were randomly divided into a trunk 
 stability exercise group and a 
 combined exercise group for 6 weeks . [ results ] 
 the trunk stability 
 exercise group showed significant improvements in 
 pain and flexibility , while the combined exercise 
 program showed significant increases in static balance , 
 balance , and stability . [ conclusion ] the results of this study suggest that 
 both trunk stability and exercise therapy may be effective in reducing pain and stability of the spine .","[ purpose ] the aim of this study was to examine the effect of trunk stability exercise and 
 combined exercise program on pain , flexibility , and static balance in chronic low back 
 pain patients . [ subjects and methods ] thirty persons diagnosed with chronic low back pain 
 were divided into a trunk stability exercise group and a combined exercise group and then 
 conducted exercise for six weeks . 
 [ results ] vas and sway lengths decreased significantly 
 in both groups . a comparison of sway lengths after the intervention between the two groups 
 revealed that the trunk stability exercise group had a bigger decrease than the combined

 exercise would have bigger effect than combined exercise on the daily activities of 
 chronic low back pain patients as it strengthens deep abdominal muscles and improves 
 flexibility and balancing ability ."
"emphysematous pyelonephritis ( ep ) is a rare but life threatening necrotizing infection of the kidney caused by gas - forming bacteria . 
 we present a case of a 49-year - old male who presented to our hospital with complaints of generalized weakness and polydipsia for two weeks . during evaluation for diabetes 
 he was found to have gas within the parenchyma of the mildly enlarged right kidney and small radiopaque shadow ( calculus ) in the midpole of the left kidney . during the evaluation for diabetic nephropathy 
 , we did not consider any surgical intervention at first place since patient was stable , afebrile and asymptomatic . however , the absence of systemic symptoms in presence of class 2 emphysema was unclear .","emphysematous pyelonephritis ( ep ) is a rare , severe gas forming infection of renal parenchyma and its surrounding areas and potentially life threatening condition that requires prompt evaluation and treatment .

"the inferior vena cava ( ivc ) filter is an established therapeutic option for the prevention of pulmonary embolism in individuals with deep venous thromboembolism , in whom conventional anticoagulation is contraindicated or deemed ineffective . 
 however , the major complications associated with ivc filters include intravascular and extravascular migration , filter and arterial thrombosis , recurrent pulmonary emboli and superior vena caval obstruction . here 
 we report a case of transvenous migration of an ivc filter to the right atrium , which lead to a very unusual scenario of acute cardiogenic shock .","dislocation and migration of the inferior vena cava filter to the right heart is an uncommon but serious complication , requiring prompt diagnosis and appropriate therapy . 
 we report the case of a seventy - year old man , who had previously undergone vena cava filter implantation and who was admitted to the intensive care unit due to acute respiratory distress with the suspect of pneumonia - related sepsis . due to the worsening of hemodynamics and the development of cardiogenic shock , the patient underwent bedside echocardiography , which on the contrary revealed dislocation of the filter and the entrapment of the device within the tricuspid valve and chordae tendineae . 
 this evidence was confirmed also by the chest - abdominal x - ray . 
 the patient underwent tricuspid valve surgical replacement and successfully recovered . 
 the transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographies performed in the intensive care unit were able to first orient the diagnostic efforts toward the correct cause ."
"neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( nms ) is a rare but life - threatening side effect of antipsychotic medications . 
 it is suggested that the ability to create nms by neuroleptics is associated with their ability to block dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway , mesocortical pathway , and hypothalamic nucleus . in this article 
 , we report a case of nms associated with olanzapine therapy in a young male patient .","neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( nms ) is a rare but life - threatening idiosyncratic side effect resulting from neuroleptic drugs . 
 nms mainly occurs in patients treated with high - potency typical antipsychotics , but rarely caused by atypical antipsychotics . 
 although nms is less common with atypical antipsychotic , but it seems that its incidence is rising due to increased administration of such drugs . 
 we present the case of a 27-year - old man with a history of paranoid schizophrenia that showed signs consistent with nms that occurred after treatment with olanzapine . 
 the patient was adherent to treatment . 
 he had decreased level of consciousness , muscle rigidity , diaphoresis , fever , drooling , urinary incontinence , and high blood pressure . 
 this patient illustrates that nms can occur due to treatment with atypical antipsychotic drugs like olanzapine , particularly in the presence of risk factors . 
 this phenomenon is often unrecognized , underdiagnosed , or not treated properly . 
 physicians should be aware that nms with extrapyramidal syndrome could occur with olanzapine at steady state doses without recent dosage adjustments or titration . 
 it is essential that adequate and safe dose of medication is chosen and the patient is monitored by the signs and symptoms of this lethal syndrome ."

"alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is the most common type of dementia , and accounts for an estimated 60 to 80% of cases . 
 loss of cholinergic neurons is a pathological hallmark of ad , and is also assessed in human imaging studies . in the pathophysiology of ad 
 , nachr - expressing neurons are down - regulated in the brains of ad patients , especially in affected brain areas , and appears to be correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment and the amount of amyloid deposition . in this review 
 we discuss the use of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligand for the treatment of ad .","the cholinergic system is involved in a broad spectrum of brain function , and its failure has been implicated in alzheimer 's disease . acetylcholine transduces signals through muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors , both of which influence synaptic plasticity and cognition . 
 however , the mechanisms that relate the rapid gating of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to persistent changes in brain function have remained elusive . 
 recent evidence indicates that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors activities affect synaptic morphology and density , which result in persistent rearrangements of neural connectivity . 
 further investigations of the relationships between nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and rearrangements of neural circuitry in the central nervous system may help understand the pathogenesis of alzheimer 's disease ."

"desmoid tumors ( dts ) , also known as aggressive fibromatoses , are characterized as rare , slow - growing tumors that develop adjacent to the spinal column . 
 although strictly benign , they are locally invasive with a high rate of recurrence even after seemingly total resection . a total of five reported cases have described this phenomenon in the absence of gardner syndrome , a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) , or any other predisposing genetic diseases . here 
 we report a case of postlaminectomy desmoid tumor that developed 10 months after corpectomy and spinal fusion for treatment of an atypical vertebral hemangioma in the thoracic spine .","study design  case report . 
 objective  the objective of the article is to illustrate a case of desmoid tumor ( dt ) formation after posterior instrumentation of the thoracic spine . 
 methods  a 57-year - old woman presented with lower extremity clumsiness , balance , and ambulation difficulty resulting from spinal cord compression due to an upper thoracic atypical vertebral hemangioma . 
 ten months after undergoing embolization , resection , and placement of instrumentation for this lesion , the patient developed a growing mass at the rostral end of the incision . 
 biopsy revealed desmoid fibromatosis . 
 the mass was removed via an en bloc resection . 
 histology revealed an infiltrative dt above the laminectomy site abutting the instrumentation . 
 results  at 2-year follow - up , there was no evidence of recurrence of the tumor . 
 conclusion  paraspinal dts have been reported in the literature to develop after surgical procedures of the spine . 
 often times , patients attribute swelling or fullness at the site of their surgery to scar tissue formation or instrumentation 
 . one must consider the possibility of a dt in the setting of reported surgical site fullness or mass after spine surgery . 
 it is thought that postoperative inflammation present in the surgical bed may promote formation of dts . 
 instrumentation may also contribute to inflammation and increase the likelihood of developing a dt . 
 generous margins must be taken to prevent recurrence ."

"micromotion of dental implants has been defined as minimal displacement of an implant body relative to the surrounding tissue which can not be recognized with the naked eye . 
 however , it has been postulated that micromotion between implant and bone must not exceed a threshold value of 150 micrometer ( m ) for successful implant healing . in traditional loading protocols , where implants are allowed to heal undisturbed for periods of several months , 
 the issue of implant micromromotion is of limited importance . with the advent of modern treatment concepts including early and immediate loading of the dental implants , with implants 
 being restored early in the healing phase , the issue has gained significant importance . in this paper 
 , it was the purpose of mechanically describe the phenomenon of micormotion occurring between the implant and alveolar bone using simple spring models , continuum mechanics models , and 3d - finite - element models simulating varying contact types between implant , bone , and bone .","micromotion of dental implants may interfere with the process of osseointegration . using three different types of virtual biomechanical models , varying contact types between implant and bone 
 were simulated , and implant deformation , bone deformation , and stress at the implant - bone interface were recorded under an axial load of 200  n , which reflects a common biting force . without friction between implant and bone , a symmetric loading situation of the bone with maximum loading and displacement at the apex of the implant 
 was recorded . 
 the addition of threads led to a decrease in loading and displacement at the apical part , but loading and displacement were also observed at the vertical walls of the implants . introducing friction between implant and bone decreased global displacement . in a force 
 fit situation , load transfer predominantly occurred in the cervical area of the implant . for freshly inserted implants , 
 micromotion was constant along the vertical walls of the implant , whereas , for osseointegrated implants , the distribution of micromotion depended on the location . in the cervical aspect some minor micromotion in the range of 0.75  m could be found , while at the most apical part almost no relative displacement between implant and bone occurred ."

"colonic perforation may occur either as a sequela of various colorectal diseases or as a complication of colonoscopy . in addition , recent advent of endoscopic submucosal dissection ( esd ) resulted in high incidence of colonic perforations although the indication for endoscopic therapy is expanded .","colonic perforation occurs in a variety of clinical scenarios and colonoscopy - associated perforation is one of the important reasons for colonic perforation . 
 colonoscopy - associated perforation may be diagnosed during colonoscopy procedure by the visualization of evident colonic wall defect or , after the completion of colonoscopy , by the visualization of leaked air in the peritoneal or retroperitoneal space . 
 recently , the incidence of colonoscopy - associated perforation increased because of the introduction of colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection .

 we developed a reliable quantitative real - time pcr with sybr green i dye and studied 13 patients with sma and their 24 parents , as well as 326 healthy normal individuals . 
 the copy number of the smn1 gene was determined by the comparative threshold cycle ( ct ) method and albumin was used as a reference gene . 
 the homozygous smn1 deletion ratio of patients was 0.00 and the hemizygous smn1 deletion ratio of parents ranged from 0.39 to 0.59 .

 total , 46 elderly individuals over 65  years of age who were attending senior welfare 
 centers participated in this study . through a hearing test , the speech frequency pure tone 
 average in the better ear was checked . 
 we set a criterion of hearing loss if the better 
 ear hearing level ( behl ) value was 25 db or more . 
 cognition ability was evaluated using 
 the korean mini - mental state examination ( k - mmse ) . 
 dynamic balance ability was evaluated 
 by the timed up and go ( tug ) test , and static balance ability was tested using a one - leg 
 stance test ( olst ) . 
 [ results ] the ages of the subjects were all related to behl , tug , 
 k - mmse , and olst . 
 behl had a negative correlation with olst , whereas it had no correlation 
 with k - mmse or tug . 
 the hearing loss group had a significantly shorter olst time than the 
 normal hearing group . 
 [ conclusion ] as elderly individuals get older , their hearing and 
 cognition , as well as their balance abilities deteriorate . 
 the results of this study 
 indicate there is a significant correlation between hearing loss and static balance ."
"adenoid cystic carcinoma ( acc ) represents the second most common malignancy of the salivary glands and is associated with a poor long term prognosis .

 , this key question should be solved in order to validate the score using a meaningful outcome variable.the inclusion of more nutrition - related indices in the model , such as the tolerance to enteral feeding , or the magnitude of the catabolic response ( for example , insulin resistance , nitrogen balance ) could enhance the specificity of a nutritional score , while the use of nonspecific severity scores ( acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii and sequential organ failure assessment ) in the calculation of the nutric score could decrease its potential predictive accuracy .","the description of a new score of nutrition risk in critically ill patients in the previous issue of critical care is very appropriate and timely .

 the functional significance of this difference in ros level in the two progenitor types remains unresolved2,3 . 
 here , we show that drosophila multipotent haematopoietic progenitors which are largely akin to the mammalian myeloid progenitors4 display elevated levels of ros under in vivo physiological conditions , which is downregulated upon differentiation . 
 scavenging the ros from these haematopoietic progenitors using in vivo genetic tools , retards their differentiation into mature blood cells . 
 conversely , increasing the haematopoietic progenitor ros beyond their basal level triggers precocious differentiation into all three mature blood cell types found in drosophila , through a signaling pathway that involves jnk and foxo activation as well as polycomb downregulation . 
 we conclude that the developmentally regulated , moderately high ros level in the progenitor population sensitizes them to differentiation , and establishes a signaling role for ros in the regulation of haematopoietic cell fate . 
 our results lead to a model that could be extended to reveal a probable signaling role for ros in the differentiation of cmps in mammalian haematopoietic development and oxidative stress response ."

 pancreatic islets secrete insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis , and while rhythmic control of insulin release is recognized to be dysregulated in humans with diabetes4 , it is not known how the circadian clock may affect this process . here 
 we show that pancreatic islets possess self - sustained circadian gene and protein oscillations of the transcription factors clock and bmal1 . 
 the phase of oscillation of islet genes involved in growth , glucose metabolism , and insulin signaling is delayed in circadian mutant mice , and both clock5,6 and bmal17 mutants exhibit impaired glucose tolerance , reduced insulin secretion , and defects in size and proliferation of pancreatic islets that worsen with age . 
 clock disruption leads to transcriptome - wide alterations in the expression of islet genes involved in growth , survival , and synaptic vesicle assembly . 
 remarkably , conditional ablation of the pancreatic clock causes diabetes mellitus due to defective -cell function at the very latest stage of stimulus - secretion coupling . 
 these results demonstrate a role for the -cell clock in coordinating insulin secretion with the sleep - wake cycle , and reveal that ablation of the pancreatic clock can trigger onset of diabetes mellitus ."

 cytoplasmic mislocalization and inclusion formation are common pathological features of tdp-43 and fus proteinopathies .

"the sufficiency of hypothalamo - pituitary - adrenal ( hpa ) function over time following subarachnoid hemorrhage ( sah ) is addressed . 
 we interpret the findings by the authors on the basis of increases in circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) , but not of circulating cortisol , with increasing clinical severity of sah , and that some ( relative ) adrenal insufficiency is present in severely afflicted patients in the acute phase , compared to controls , even though the study does not allow one to determine whether controls ( after aneurysm surgery ) were equally stressed . in any case , lower cortisol levels than in acute sah patients suggest lower stress levels .","this commentary on a paper by bendel and colleagues in the previous issue of critical care describes the difficulty in assessing the sufficiency of adrenal responses to endogenous , stress - induced adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) release by the pituitary or to exogenous acth administration in the critically ill patient in general , and after subarachnoid hemorrhage in particular . 
 it is argued that comparisons with responses under circumstances of equal stress as well as assessments of severity of disease are necessary to judge the sufficiency of cortisol responses to endogenous and exogenous acth before treatment is considered . 
 there are no universally applicable cutoff values for cortisol levels  and increases in cortisol levels with increasing levels of acth  for the diagnosis of relative adrenal insufficiency ( or as it is now commonly termed , critical illnes - related corticosteroid insufficiency ) following , for example , subarachnoid hemorrhage or other intracranial catastrophes .

"we conducted an experiment in which we compared the points of subjective equality ( pses ) in terms of the body width ( i.e. when figures with horizontal and vertical stripes look equally fat ) for relatively thin and fat figures . 
 stimuli used in our experiment : ( a ) a pair of thin figures and ( b ) the pair of fat figures , where a positive pse supports helmholtz ( a person with horizontal stripes appeared thinner than one with vertical stripes ) , whereas a negative pse supports the common belief ( a fat body appeared fatter ) . to test this hypothesis 
 , we compared pses for the two body conditions : all averaged , block 1 , and block 2. 
 there seems to be a strong hysteresis effect , because the results in the second block are pulled towards those of the thin body ( f(1 , 26 ) = 6.573 , p = 0.0165 , by a three - way mixed - design analysis of variance for block order  gender  body type ) .","a square filled with horizontal stripes is perceived as thinner than one with vertical stripes ( helmholtz illusion ) .

 data of patients who received caffeine base formulations from 2006 till 2011 were selected in both centers , and data on total numbers of patients admitted per gestational age group were also collected.resultsin both centers 
 caffeine was used in 68 neonates who were treated with caffeine and in 68 patients who were not treated with other caffeine regimens . in all patients , 
 no significant adverse effects were observed . in addition , there was no significant difference in the dose of caffeine ( 0.5  mg / kg / day ) or in the dosage of caffeine for the duration of treatment ( p < 0.05 ) .   however , there were no significant differences in the amount of caffeine consumed ( p = 0.001 ) between the two nicus . in conclusion 
 , caffeine may be considered as the treatment of last resort before endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation .","apnoea of prematurity is treated with noninvasive respiratory therapy and methylxanthines . for therapy

 64.8% of patients did not need intubation after doxapram . 
 25% of treated neonates were < 27 weeks of gestation . 
 a positive response to doxapram therapy on apnoea was associated with longer duration of doxapram usage ( p < 0.001 ) , lower mean doses ( p < 0.003 ) , and less days of intensive care ( median 33 versus 42 days ; p < 0.002 ) . 
 no patients died during doxapram therapy .

 are confirmed in prospective trials , doxapram should be used with caution ."
"the role of myeloid differentiation factor 88 ( myd88 ) in inflammation - driven tumorigenesis is still unclear . 
 recent work has positioned myd 88 as a critical downstream signaling molecule for both the toll - like receptor ( tlr ) family of microbial pattern recognition receptors and the il-1 and -18 receptors as a central player in tumor - promoting inflammation . in the diethylnitrosamine model of liver cancer , 
 tlrs can recognize a wide range of highly conserved microbial products , potentially implicating occult infections or normal flora in the tumor - associated inflammation , suggesting that tumors may be aberrant consequences of initially physiological immune responses . in addition 
 , tlr signaling is important for the initiation of neutrophil infiltration in response to necrotic cells , and it may also have important tumor - intrinsic effects .","mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity play a pivotal role in the development of cancer . 
 chronic inflammation can drive tumor development , but antitumor immunity can also restrict or even prevent tumor growth . 
 new data show that feed - forward signals downstream of the receptor for advanced glycation end - products ( rage ) can fuel chronic inflammation , creating a microenvironment that is ideal for tumor formation ."

 syncope is one of the rarest presentations in patients with cm - i . 
 there are many hypotheses regarding the causes of syncope in patients with cm - i ; however , the mechanisms are not clearly understood . 
 although surgical decompression for cm - i in patients with syncope has yielded good clinical results in some studies , such cases are rarely reported . 
 we report a case of orthostatic syncope in a patient with cm - i who was treated with surgical intervention ."

"vascular fibrillation ( vf ) is one of the most common causes of death in humans . 
 the available reports indicate that there are two types of vf , first , sustained vf requiring electrical defibrillation and secondly , transient vf that spontaneously reverts to sinus rhythm without electrical defillation . in this review 
 we have suggested that : comparison the mhc isoforms of different mammals at different ages.methodsthe mammalian myocardium expresses up to three myosin heavy chain isoforms that differ in their atpase activity ( serca 2a , v1 , v2 , and v3 ) . in the present study , we have compared the type of sustained vfs and the respective expression of the cardiac myosins heavy chain ( mhhc ) isoform profile.resultswe found that transient vfs can be facilitate in mammals with low v1 myocardial activity ( newborn rats and guinea pigs and adult dogs and pigs ) , but not in mammals that have high v1 serca activity ( young and old rats , rabbits , cats and puppies ) .","abstractthe present paper deals with spontaneous ventricular defibrillation in mammals and the possibility to facilitate its occurrence . 
 clinical and experimental evidence suggest that in the majority of cases , ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) is permanent , requiring defibrillation by electric shock . 
 however , a growing number of reports show that vf can terminate spontaneously in various mammals , including human beings.the mechanisms involved in spontaneous ventricular defibrillation are controversial . 
 available reports imply that intracellular ca2 + overload is the key event triggering vf and preventing its reversal . 
 since the sarcoplasmatic reticulum is the main intracellular ca2 + regulating organelle and the activity of the cardiac sr ca2 + atpase ( serca 2a ) is its prime element of ca2 + sequestration , spontaneous ventricular defibrillation likely requires high level of serca 2a activity . 
 we suggest that mammalian hearts with high serca 2a activity defibrillate spontaneously and those with low activity only after its enhancement . since high serca 2a activity is co - expressed with the myosin heavy chain ( mhc ) isoform v1 , we assumed that those hearts preferentially expressing v1 mhc are able to defibrillate spontaneously 
 . hearts with small amounts of v1 mhc and correspondingly lower level of serca 2a activity can only defibrillate following administration of compounds that augment serca 2a activity and prevent intracellular ca2 + overload ."
